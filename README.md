# Twitter_Analysis

Tasks
Part 1. Basic Stats 
1. Count the total number of tweets, describing how you deal with duplicates or
other anomalies in the data set. [5 marks]
2. Plot a time-series of the number of tweets by day using the whole dataset and
comment on what you see. [5 marks]
3. Use box and whisker diagrams to compare the average number of tweets on
weekdays to the numbers for weekend days. Are there statistically significant
differences between the number of tweets on weekdays and weekends? [5
marks]
4. Plot a time-series of the number of tweets by hour, averaged over all
weekdays and comment on what you see. [5 marks]


Part 2. Users
1. Make a histogram with the number of users on the y-axis and number of
tweets they make on the x-axis. Discuss the distribution that you see. All the
users in the data set should be included! [5 marks]
2. Find the top-5 users by total number of tweets. Do you think any are
automated accounts (aka. bots)? Justify your answer. [5 marks]
3. Find the 5 users who receive the most mentions and comment on this. [5
marks]
4. Choose 4 countries and compute how often they mention each other. This
means you should compute 16 numbers e.g. UK mentions UK, UK mentions
France, France mentions UK etc. Comment on any patterns you observe. [5
marks]
Part 3. Mapping
1. Draw a map of Europe that displays the use of Twitter across the continent.
Use only the GPS-tagged tweets, these are tweets which have a
“coordinates” field in the metadata. The exact form of the map is up to you:
marks will be given for accuracy, clarity and presentation. [10 marks]
2. Explain any patterns you observe. [5 marks]
3. The rest of the tweets should have a “place” tag. For these tweets, plot the
CDF of the bounding box diagonals and comment. [5 marks]
4. Find one additional spatial dataset, produce a map comparing Twitter activity
with the other dataset and discuss. Your secondary dataset doesn’t have to
cover the entire bounding box e.g. it could be for a single city or nation. [10
marks]
Part 4. Events
1. Identify 3 days with unusually high activity in 3 different countries of your
choosing. For example you could choose one day in the UK, one in France
and one in Turkey. Describe and justify how you identify ‘unusual’ days. [5
marks]
2. Characterise each of these three days by
a. Making a word cloud from the tweet text. [5 marks]
b. Any other method. [5 marks]
3. Summarise the events you have detected and validate your discussion with
some other source of data e.g. news articles. [5 marks]

Part 5. Reflection (10 marks)
Using social media to study the real world is very common in academia, the media
and in industry. Now that you have some experience analysing Twitter data, discuss
the use and misuse of Twitter. In particular:
- What are the drawbacks of Twitter data?
- What ethical concerns might there be in using Twitter data in different
applications?
Write no more than 500 words in total. Remember, this is an academic writing
exercise. You should be citing sources and justifying your opinions with
evidence/analysis
